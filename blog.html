        <b>My story starts when I went to the local music school in my hometown at the age of 5</b>. This is when I started to learn how to read and write music.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-secondary-text">
        <b>At the age of 6 I had written my first song</b>, which I still keep it as part of the memory lane. One year later I started learning trumpet and went on a rampage of live events with the local band as the 3rd trumpet in the local philharmonic band.
        <p class="bio-secondary-text">
        At the age of 10 I started playing <b>Violin</b> and, again, I had the chance to play live in the streets and stages of Portugal. This is when I decided to go electric and asked my dad to buy me an electric bass as my main music reference was Mark Hoppus from Blink182. Punk, Rock and Metal started to run in my blood and suddenly I was part of a Rock band, however, I decided that guitar could be more interesting for me. That is when I took some guitar lessons and decided that I should do something with music for my life.
        <p class="bio-secondary-text">
        At the age of 21 I went to Restart in Lisbon, Portugal, and studied for a level 4 diploma as sound technician and started working with some other musicians from Lisbon. There I had the chance to play live and work in studios, which gave me the idea of getting a deeper knowledge of the Audio subject. At the age of 27 I went to University of West London where I studied BSc. Applied Sound Engineering obtaining a final grade of first class honours degree and MSc. Digital Audio Engineering obtaining a grade of Merit.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-secondary-text">
        Currently I work as a Senior Engineer at CineArk where I am responsible for building audio and video related gear for the film industry. I also write my own songs, mix and master, and provide services for mixing and mastering audio.
